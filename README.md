Simple lane following program for Romi robot using WPILibPi OS. Along with the python code for vision processing (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vRAoAbKzitqoRYhyIdQUHRC3gRxz0MJO/view?usp=sharing), the robot will detect lane marking (using light-color tape) and drive on or between them depending on the mode (single-centered or double-sided lane markings).
